# AoC 2023
This year I'm going back to C# and I'll be using newer language features that I'm used to and some new suitable algorithms. I'll also try to make my code understandable as always and do some refactoring on the code. As with every year I try to arrive at my own solutions and not look for help if I get stuck. 

Happy AoC-mas!
